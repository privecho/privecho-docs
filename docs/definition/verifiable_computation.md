Verifiable computation is an important tool for ensuring the correctness of computations, especially in decentralized environments:

- Difficulty of verifying computations: Traditional computation verification often requires redoing the calculations, which consumes a lot of resources.
- Trade-off between efficiency and security: Achieving fast and secure verification of computational results without increasing the computational burden is a significant challenge.
