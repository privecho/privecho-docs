Integration of verifiable computation and verifiable AI models:

- zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs: Provide fast, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs suitable for large-scale decentralized environments.
- Verifiable AI: Ensures that the outputs of AI models can be verified by third parties, increasing trust and acceptance.
