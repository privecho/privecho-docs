Enhancing the performance and decentralization of blockchain systems:

- New consensus mechanisms: Such as Proof of Stake (PoS) and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), which improve processing speed and energy efficiency.
- Scalability solutions: Including sharding technology and layer-2 scaling solutions, supporting larger-scale transaction processing.
