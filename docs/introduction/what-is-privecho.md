Account abstraction is based on EVM blockchain's latest solution for wallet security.

First announced in September 2021, several key blockchain professionals, including Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, wrote the account abstraction proposal. This proposal came with several crucial objectives, including:

- Elimination of EOAs: Externally owned accounts (EOAs) are wallet solutions that rely on a cryptographic pair of 
private and public keys to carry out wallet activities. Compared to code-based accounts that use smart contracts to validate wallet activities, EOAs tend to be less versatile and secure. Account abstraction aims to eliminate EOAs by enabling all users to use smart contract wallets as their primary accounts.
- Decentralization: Account abstraction will help to further the decentralization initiative that lies at the core of 
  blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. Among other things, account abstraction will enable all wallet activity to happen over a public mempool (a publicly available list of pending transactions) and limit access to direct communication addresses like IP addresses.
- Support for Other Use Cases: Ultimately, account abstraction is considered a key feature to support additional 
  blockchain use cases, such as privacy-preserving applications, aggregated signatures, and atomic multi-operations. Account abstraction will likely prove to be an important addition to the blockchain ecosystem that enables further scalability and evolution in the future.

What is arguably most important about this proposal is that it enables the creation of programmable smart contract wallets without requiring consensus from the blockchain network. This helps to improve user experience (UX) and improves the flexibility of the technology as well.
